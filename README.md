Simple Task App

This is a very basic task app made with HTML and JavaScript.

///What it does
 Add a task with name, category, and deadline.
 Shows all tasks in a list.
 You can mark tasks as "Completed".
 If the date has passed, it shows as "Overdue".
 Tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.

/// Reflection
When I started this project, I found JavaScript really confusing. I had trouble remembering how to connect my HTML with the JS file and how to make the button actually do something when clicked.  
At first, I didn’t understand how to use things like addEventListener or how to create elements on the page using JavaScript. I had to look at examples from class and try different things until it finally worked.  

Another thing I struggled with was saving the tasks. I didn’t know what localStorage was or how it worked, so I spent a lot of time figuring out how to make the tasks stay after refreshing the page. I broke the code a few times, but I kept testing small pieces until it finally worked.  

This project helped me understand JavaScript better. I learned about arrays, objects, and how to use loops to show data on the screen. It’s not perfect, but I’m proud that I got it to work.  
If I had more time, I would add a delete button and maybe make it look a bit nicer with more colors and styling.
